# Plan Generator 

## Description

A utility allowing users to interface with the Bored API [https://www.boredapi.com/] to generate, save, and favorite "random" todos.

## Status

Should currently be bug-free; if you find a bug, please message me on GitHub!

## Usage

You should start out with an empty list. To add a random To-Do item to your list of plans, click 'Generate New Todo'. You should see a random item from the Bored API appear in the center of the window.

For any given plan, click 'Save' to save it to your list of Saved Plans, on the right-hand side. Click 'Delete' to wipe it off your screen entirely.

Within your list of saved plans, click the 'Favorite' button under any plan to toggle the highlighted 'Favorite' status for that specific plan. Click the checkbox next to any given plan item to mark it complete. You can clear completed plans by clicking the 'Clear Checked' button underneath your list of saved plans.
